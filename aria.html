                <p class="body-text">Hello! My name is Aria Strasser, and I am a GIMM major/Computer Science minor! I enjoy programming, playing games, 
                and volunteering at BSU Esports.</p>

                <h2>Favorite Games</h2>
                <p class="body-text">The games I have spent the most time on are Warframe and League of Legends. In Warframe I main
                a burst character named Mirage, and in League I main quite a few characters in the support role (Rell, Thresh, and 
                Seraphine are my top ones). I've been working on my Top and Mid roles in League as well, on Ahri, Malphite, and Cho'Gath.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Reptiles</h2>
                <p class="body-text">I also love reptiles! I have a snake named Tupigh and a grouchy bearded dragon named Chroma.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Other Hobbies</h2>
                <p class="body-text">I also have quite a few hobbies I like to dabble in, like making silly videos from game clips, arranging 
                music, and drawing (I didn't draw my avatar picture though, that was done by a really talented friend of mine).</p>
                <p class="body-text">Here are some fun examples of edited videos I've done (These are some early quick versions, so they are still a work in progress)</p>
